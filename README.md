* [Single Number](single_number.py)
  * Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one.

* [Happy Number](happy_number.py)
  * Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is "happy".
  * A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy numbers.
  * Return True if `n` is a happy number, and False if not.

* [Maximum Subarray](maximum_subarray.py)
  * Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

* [Move Zeroes](move_zeroes.py)
  * Given an array `nums`, write a function to move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

* [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](stock_buy_sell.py)
  * Say you have an array `prices` for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
  * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
  * Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

* [Group Anagrams](group_anagrams.py)
  * Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

* [Counting Elements](count_element.py)
  * Given an integer array `arr`, count element `x` such that `x + 1` is also in `arr`.
  * If there're duplicates in `arr`, count them seperately.
