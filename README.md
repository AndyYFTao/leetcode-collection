* [Single Number](single_number.py)
  * Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one.

* [Happy Number](happy_number.py)
  * Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is "happy".
  * A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy numbers.
  * Return True if `n` is a happy number, and False if not.

* [Maximum Subarray](maximum_subarray.py)
  * Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

* [Move Zeroes](move_zeroes.py)
  * Given an array `nums`, write a function to move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

* [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](stock_buy_sell.py)
  * Say you have an array `prices` for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
  * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
  * Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

* [Group Anagrams](group_anagrams.py)
  * Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

* [Counting Elements](count_element.py)
  * Given an integer array `arr`, count element `x` such that `x + 1` is also in `arr`.
  * If there're duplicates in `arr`, count them seperately.
  
* [Middle of the Linked List](middle_linked_list.py)
  * Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node `head`, return a middle node of linked list.
  * If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

* [Backspace String Compare](backspace_string_compare.py)
  * Given two strings `S` and `T`, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. `#` means a backspace character.

* [Min Stack](min_stack.py)
  * Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
  
* [Diameter of Binary Tree](diameter_of_binary_tree.py)
  * Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the **longest** path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
  * The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
  
* [Last Stone Weight](last_stone_weight.py)
  * We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.
  * Each turn, we choose the two **heaviest** stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:
    * If `x == y`, both stones are totally destroyed;
    * If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y-x`.
  * At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)
